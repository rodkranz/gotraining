/* A note on users
 *
 * Internally, in Pachyderm, usernames are structured strings. This makes both
 * our API and our data model more flexible (at the loss of some type safety).
 * Basically, anywhere that Pachyderm internally stores a subject (i.e.
 * TokenInfo) or principal (ACL, the 'admins' collection), that username will
 * have some structured prefix.
 *
 * Note that externally-facing principals ({Get,Set}{Scope,ACL}, ModifyAdmins,
 * ListAdmins) will have their own conventions
 *
 * The current user formats are:
 * 1) GitHub usernames:
 *      "github:MyGitHubUsername"
 * 2) Pachyderm robot users:
 *      "robot:robot_user_1"
